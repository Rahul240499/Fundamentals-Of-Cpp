// Comments in C++
// The preprocessor strips all the comments from source file and replaces each comment with single space 

//<= it's a single line comment 

/* This is a multiple line commment
So just enjoy .Multiline comments are often seen at the beginning of the program.
 Dont comment the obvious only comment the important ,complex part */
